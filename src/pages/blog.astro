                <h4>Potential for Distraction:</h4>

                    Despite its benefits, WFH can present challenges in terms of distractions. Household chores, family members, or pets may interrupt workflow, requiring discipline and time management skills.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Social Isolation:</h4>
                <p>Remote work may lead to feelings of isolation or loneliness due to limited social interaction. This can impact morale and mental well-being if not addressed.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Working from the Office (WFO):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Structured Environment:</h4>
                <p>
                    The office provides a structured environment conducive to productivity. Separating work from home life can help individuals focus and maintain a professional mindset.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Collaboration Opportunities:</h4>
                <p>
                    In-office work facilitates spontaneous collaboration and brainstorming sessions, fostering teamwork and innovation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Networking:</h4>
                <p>
                    Being physically present in the office allows for networking opportunities that may not be as readily available when working remotely. Building relationships with colleagues and superiors can be beneficial for career advancement.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Commute Stress:</h4>
                <p>
                    While commuting to the office can be stressful, it also serves as a buffer between work and home life, allowing employees to mentally prepare for the day ahead or decompress after work.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Inflexibility:</h4>
                <p>
                    Working from the office often entails rigid schedules and less autonomy compared to remote work. This lack of flexibility may pose challenges for individuals with familial or personal obligations.
